[role="_abstract"]
With the {cli-product-long} `rhoas` command-line interface (CLI), you can manage {registry-product-long} from a terminal.

As a developer of applications and services,
you can use `rhoas` to create {registry} instances and connect your applications and services to these instances.
You can also manage artifacts.
Artifacts are items stored in {registry}, like schemas and API specifications.

This guide describes how to get started quickly by doing the following tasks:
