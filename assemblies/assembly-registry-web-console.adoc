====
{product-long} is currently available for Development Preview. Development Preview releases provide early access to a limited set of features that might not be fully tested and that might change in the final GA version. Users are discouraged from using Development Preview software in production or for business-critical workloads. Limited documentation is available for Development Preview releases and is typically focused on fundamental user goals.

Manage schema and API artifacts stored in the {product-long} cloud service using the {registry} web console. 

You can use the web console to browse and search the schema and API artifacts and optional groups stored in {registry}, and to add new schema and API artifacts, groups, and versions. You can search for artifacts by label, name, group, or description. You can view an artifactâ€™s content or its available versions, or download an artifact file locally.

You can configure optional rules for registry content, both globally and for each schema and API artifact. These optional rules for content validation and compatibility are applied when new schema and API artifacts or versions are uploaded to the registry.
