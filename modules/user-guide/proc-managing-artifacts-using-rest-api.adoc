= Managing schema and API artifacts using Registry REST API commands

[role="_abstract"]
This section shows a simple curl-based example of using the registry v2 core REST API to add and retrieve an Apache Avro schema artifact in the registry. 

.Prerequisites

* {registry} must be installed and running in your environment. 

.Procedure

. Add an artifact to the registry using the `/groups/\{group\}/artifacts` operation. The following example `curl` command adds a simple artifact for a share price application:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-type: application/json; artifactType=AVRO" \ 
  -H "X-Registry-ArtifactId: share-price" \ <1>
  --data '{"type":"record","name":"price","namespace":"com.example", \ 
   "fields":[{"name":"symbol","type":"string"},{"name":"price","type":"string"}]}' \ <2>
  http://MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2/groups/my-group/artifacts <3>
----
+
<1> This example adds an Avro schema artifact with an artifact ID of `share-price`. If you do not specify a unique artifact ID, {registry} generates one automatically as a UUID. 
<2> `MY-REGISTRY-URL` is the 
ifdef::apicurio-registry[]
host name on which {registry} is deployed. For example: `\http://localhost:8080`.
endif::[]
ifdef::rh-service-registry[]
host name on which {registry} is deployed. For example: `my-cluster-service-registry-myproject.example.com`. 
endif::[]
ifdef::rh-openshift[]
URL on which {registry} is deployed. For example: `\https://service-registry.apps.app-sre-0.k3s7.p1.openshiftapps.com/t/f301375a-18a7-426c-bbd8-8e626a0a1d0e`. 
endif::[]
<3> This example specifies a group ID of `my-group` in the API path. If you do not specify a unique group ID, you must specify `../groups/default` in the API path. 

. Verify that the response includes the expected JSON body to confirm that the artifact was added. For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
{"createdBy":"","createdOn":"2021-04-16T09:07:51+0000","modifiedBy":"", 
"modifiedOn":"2021-04-16T09:07:51+0000","id":"share-price","version":"1", <1>
"type":"AVRO","globalId":2,"state":"ENABLED","groupId":"my-group","contentId":2} <2>
----
<1> No version was specified when adding the artifact, so the default version `1` is created automatically.
<2> This was the second artifact added to the registry, so the global ID and content ID have a value of `2`. 
. Retrieve the artifact content from the registry using its artifact ID in the API path. In this example, the specified ID is `share-price`:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2/groups/my-group/artifacts/share-price \ 
{"type":"record","name":"price","namespace":"com.example", \
  "fields":[{"name":"symbol","type":"string"},{"name":"price","type":"string"}]}
